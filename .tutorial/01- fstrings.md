# f-strings

f-strings (format strings) are the best way to combine variables and text together. Everything up until now has been...well...awkward.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's look at how we have combined variables and text in the past...concatenating.

```python
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is", name, "using", pronouns, "pronouns and is age", age)
```

##

ðŸ‘‰ Let's now use an f-string for this same code. What changes did I make to this code?

```python
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))
```
**Change 1:** Using `{}` as a placeholder for the variable.
**Change 2:** Adding `.format(variable names, commas)`
