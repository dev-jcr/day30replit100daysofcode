ðŸ‘‰ What's wrong with this code:

```python
for i in range(1, 31):
  print("Day {i} of 100")
```

We missed the `f` before the string OR we need to add `.format`

```python
for i in range(1, 31):
  print(f"Day {i} of 100")
```
OR

```python
for i in range(1, 31):
  print("Day {count} of 100".format(count=i))
```

f-strings must have `f` before them or `.format` after  them or they will not work.
