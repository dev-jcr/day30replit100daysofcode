# ðŸ‘‰ Day 30 Challenge

- Create a program that uses a loop that asks the user what they have thought of each of the 30 days of challenges so far. 

- For each day, prompt the user to answer a question and restate it in a full sentence that is center aligned underneath the heading.

Example:
```
30 Days Down

Day 1: 
Amazing

            You thought Day 1 was amazing.
Day 2:
so good that I bought the David plushie

              You thought Day 2 was so good...
```

<details> <summary> ðŸ’¡ Hints </summary>

- Look at the common error for help on the loop.
- Create an `input` statement for the user to express what they thought of that day.
- `print` using an f-string.
- Think about what symbol you need for center alignment. How many spaces should you move your statement?
- Think about the length of the heading. Maybe that's how many spaces you would need to center align the text.
